Iomrascálaí
===========

Iomrascálaí
([see here for the pronunciation](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ujh/iomrascalai/master/pronunciation.mp4))
is an AI for the game of Go/Weiqi/Baduk written in Rust. Please note
that we're using the Rust nightly build and not 0.10!

Development
===========

See the [Github issues](https://github.com/ujh/iomrascalai/issues) for
planned features and bugs and
[join the mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/iomrascalai)
and [the chat](https://gitter.im/ujh/iomrascalai) for discussion.
Please note that (almost) all development on Iomrascálaí is supposed
to happen with pair programming. If you want to contribute please
[contact me](http://urbanhafner.com) and I can set you up with a
pairing partner and (eventually) give you access to the Trello board
and Github repository. If that is not possible then we're also
accepting pull requests in a pinch.
