===========

Iomrascálaí
([see here for the pronunciation](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ujh/iomrascalai/master/pronunciation.mp4))
is an AI for the game of Go/Weiqi/Baduk written in Rust. 

Development
===========

See the [Trello board](https://trello.com/b/NU4MXbao/iomrascalai) for
planned features. Please note that (almost) all development on
Iomrascálaí is supposed to happen with pair programming. If you want
to contribute please [contact me](http://urbanhafner.com) and I can
set you up with a pairing partner and (eventually) give you access to
the Trello board and Github repository. If that is not possible then
we're also accepting pull requests in a pinch.
